Traditionally, vibration responses in Frequency -Based Substructuring are measured using accelerometers. This study explores the feasibility of using a Scanning Laser Doppler Vibrometer as a non -contact alternative. The instrument offers distinct advantages, such as the ability to capture vibration responses across a predetermined grid of points without physically contacting the structure. The thesis includes both a numerical simulation and a physical experiment, comparing the coupled frequency response functions of a benchmark structure (obtained via Frequency-Based Substructuring) to the reference. Results from the simulation demonstrate strong agreement between the coupled system and the reference. The physical experiment also shows good agreement, even though it is slightly lower . This discrepancy is primarily attributed to the excitation method (a piezoelectric actuator ), which is just as critical as the measurement technique for obtaining accurate vibration data."

First, we optimise the All Nearest Smaller Values algorithm from (Berkman et al., 1993), and then we design a variant of it that is suitable for running on a GPU while performingO(n)work with O(log2(n))span on n lg(n) threads on a CREW PRAM. When implemented, our GPU version achieves a 4-5 times speed-up over our CPU version. We then design a GPU version of the precomputation of Lowest Common Ancestor queries described in (Schieber & Vishkin,1988) in order to answer Range Minimum Query queries in constant time. It performsO(n)work and has O( p nlog(n) )span on q n lg(n) − 1threads on a CREW PRAM. Page 5 of 57"

The problem was first presented in [1] and combines routing and schedul- ing, two already hard classes of problems. It models a network of clients who each store a commodity. The amount each client has stored depletes over time. A client should never run out of this commodity, so we must ensure that we visit each client and refill their stock often enough. How quickly stock depletes varies from client to client, and it is allowed to visit and refill a client way before the clients stocks runs out. In this thesis we, like in [1], study both the Min-A vg and Min-Max versions of the problem, where the objectives are to minimize average cost of a route and minimize the cost of the longest route respec- tively. We cover the approximation algorithms on trees for both metrics given by [1] and we improve the complexity of their pseudo-polynomial algorithm for Min-A vg on a path. We then give a polynomial time algorithm for Min-Max on cycles, a 4-approximation for Min-A vg on cycles and insight into how a pseudo-polynomial algorithm for Min-A vg on cycles might be achieved. Finally we combine the ideas from the tree algorithms and cycle algorithms to give approximation algorithms for graphs, where all cycles are disjoint. On these graphs we give an algorithm for finding optimal routes, a 6 + NC-approximation for Min-Max, where NC is the number of cycles in a graph, and a 4-approximation for Min-A vg.

Therefore, is it chosen to investigate if the Fire Brigade Intervention Model (FBIM) can be of use in Denmark, if FBIM can be used to identify effects of different intervention strategies, and what impact using stairs vs. a firefighter lift has on the intervention. A series of interviews have been conducted with different Danish and foreign Fire and Rescue services in order to identify the different intervention strategies used in the case of fire in a high -rise. Fire and rescues services in in Denmark as well as Sweden, Finland and the US have been interviewed. The different discovered intervention strategies have been analyzed in FBIM and the result have been used in a comparative analysis. The different identified intervention strategies have been applied on a speci fic building case in order to form a basis for comparison. The result shows a positive effect on intervention times when a carefully planned standard operation procedure (SOP) is put in to use. A difference in total intervention time, time for reaching th e fire compartment ready to conduct search and rescue and time of when additional resources will arrive are identified when the different intervention strategies are compared. The result also shows the effect employment of firefighters, which have a negative effect on intervention time. If stairs are used instead of lift, the time taken to reach the fire compartment is increased by a factor of 3.0 - 3.4 depending on employment of the firefighters. Resumé Højhusbyggeriet skyder op over hele landet, men vid en om de nødvendige brandsikkerheds foranstaltninger, retningslinjer for brandsikkerhed i bygninger højere end 45 meter og viden om brandvæsnets indsats procedure i højhusene halter bagefter i Danmark. Derfor er det valgt at undersøge, om den Australske mo del ”the Fire Brigade Intervention Model” (FBIM) kan anvendes i en dansk kontekst, om FBIM kan identificere effekten ved brugen af forskellige indsats procedure, og hvilken effekt brugen af trapper kontra brandmandselevator har på hele indsatsen tiden. Der er blevet gennemført en række interviews med forskellige danske og udenlandske beredskaber. Dette med henblik på at identificere forskellige standard indsats procedurer i tilfælde af brand i e t højhus. Beredskaber fra Danmark samt Sverige, Finland og USA er blevet interviewet. De forskellige identificerede indsats procedure er analyseret i FBIM, og resultaterne underlagt en komparativ analyse. De forskellige identificerede indsats procedure er blevet an vendt på et bestemt højhus projekt for at danne grundlag for en sammenligning af resultater. Resultaterne viser en positiv effekt på indsatstiden ved brug af en nøje planlagt indsats strategi ned skrevet i en i standard operation procedure (SOP). En forske l i den samlede indsatstid, tiden til at røgdykkerholdet er klar til indsats på etagen, og tidspunktet for, hvornår yderligere ressourcer vil ankomme, kan identificeres, når de forskellige indsats procedure sammenlignes. Resultaterne viser også en positiv effekt af bru g af brandmandselevator kontra brug af trapper. Hvis trapper anvendes i stedet for elevator, øges tiden for hvornår røgdykkerne er klar på etagen med faktor 3 ,0 – 3,4 afhængigt af om der er tale om fuldtids eller deltids beredskaber."

This thesis assess the potential of three remediation strategies: Biogeochemi- cal Reductive Dechlorination (BiRD), Enhanced Reductive Dechlorination (ERD), and their combined application to treat a cDCE-dominated contaminant plume at the Naverland site in Denmark. Laboratory-scale batch experiments were conducted using bioactive ground- water and limestone to simulate site-specific conditions. Four scenarios were tested: natural attenuation, GeoForm® Soluble (a ferrous sulfate-based amendment), KB-1® (a containing microbial consortium Dehalococcoides ), and a combination of GeoForm® and KB-1®. The results demonstrated that ERD using KB-1® was the most effective approach, achiev- ing complete dechlorination of cDCE to ethene with high degradation rates. Despite its the- oretical potential, BiRD produced no observable degradation of target compounds within the study’s duration due to delayed formation of reactive iron sulphide (FeS) and insuf- ficient reductive conditions. The combined treatment accelerated FeS formation through sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) in KB-1®. The high iron and sulphide concentrations from GeoForm® inhibited Dehalococcoides activity , significantly reducing degradation eﬀiciency. Despite this inhibition, the detection of vinyl chloride and ethene at low levels confirmed persistent biotic degradation.” These findings highlight the importance of redox control, amendment compatibility , and microbial resilience in remediation design. Given the site’s hydrogeology and buffering capacity , ERD using KB-1® is recommended for field-scale implementation.

However, there are still many challenges in achieving safe and reliable decision making in confined and congested waterways. The present thesis contributes to this research area by investigating the use of Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) for decision making in Autonomous Ship Navigation (ASN) . IRL is a promising approach since it not only en­ ables learning of decision making policies but also the inference of reward functions that encode the underlying motives of expert vessel captains. The primary objectives of this thesis were to first translate the publicly available Automatic Identification System (AIS) ­ data into a format that allowed for the application of IRL methods and to subsequently learn, evaluate and compare policies and reward functions for Goal­Only Navigation (GO­ Navigation) and Environment­Aware Navigation (EA­Navigation) derived by different IRL methods. First, the AIS­data has been analysed and preprocessed using maritime domain knowl­ edge. Based on the insights gained, the available information from the AIS­data has been embedded into a Markov Decision Process (MDP) . This entailed the implementation of a 2­ Degree of Freedom (DoF) kinematic vessel simulator, the development and evalu­ ation of two observation definitions as well as the development and evaluation of three distinct methods to infer actions from AIS­data. A graph­based observation definition and a Kalman filter­based approach for action inference were chosen. Three different algorithms ­ Behaviour Cloning (BC) , Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning (AIRL) and Approximate Variational Reward Imitation Learning (AVRIL) ­ were evaluated on both navigation tasks. BC was used as a baseline and demonstrated decent waypoint­following behaviour and good signs of environmental awareness. It also helped establish that Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a superior choice for policy and reward network architectures in the EA­Navigation task. AIRL showed the best result in the GO­ Navigation setting with well­performing policies and plausible reward functions. In the EA­Navigation task, the learned policy showed insufficient behaviours, while the reward function was interpretable but only provided limited insights. AVRIL performed well for GO­Navigation but showed inconsistencies in the more complex task. High uncertainties and collapses to a standard normal distribution limited the interpretability of the reward distribution.

This enhancement enables a more responsive and economically grounded representation of fuel distribution in the context of maritime de­ carbonisation, improving the fidelity of system level assessments under regulatory and supply limitations.

Several studies have investigated this, however the results are varying. This is due to diﬀerent experimental setups and perhaps that they used diﬀerent predeﬁned areas of interest (AOIs) in the face and merely counted how long the subjects looked inside them. In this thesis, ﬁrst-order Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) with Gaussian (mixture) emissions and repeated stratiﬁed K-fold cross validation were instead used to model the face viewing patterns of individuals with and without ASD. The purpose was to construct a (Bayes) classiﬁer that could diagnose ASD solely based upon the eye tracking data obtained by Johnels et al. 2017, where subjects with and without ASD looked at short movies and images of faces showing either no emotion (neutral) or an emotion (anger, fear and happiness). When using the data obtained from looking at the images of faces with anger, fear or happiness, the classiﬁer turned out signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from random to correctly classify 6-7 out of 10 on average, whereas for neutral and all four combined it was 5-6 out of 10 correctly classiﬁed and not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from random. The performance was best using only the happy faces with a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) being 0 .657. This agrees with studies concluding a diﬀerence in viewing patterns as a function of facial emotions compared to neutral and also the study of Johnels et al. 2017 which expected and found diﬀerences speciﬁc to the happy faces. Further studies could attempt to improve the classiﬁer, for example by tailor- ing the HMM towards the speciﬁc problem, by learning more about the ASD and control groups from other features or methods and use it in the classiﬁer, by at- tempting to use the dynamic videos instead of static pictures, and ﬁnally improve the quantity and quality of the data by redoing the eye tracking experiment. 1"
"TEST.pdf","TEST","Anthropogenic impacts on marine habitats are a global problem, less than 15% Europe’s coastline areas are considered to be in a good environmental condition. Extraction of large boulders from coastal reefs for construction purposes has led to degradation of this type of habitat. Boulder reefs are important fish habitats containing complex structures that provide refuge for fish and hard substrate for benthic fauna. In the past 100 years, it has been estimated that at least 42 km2 of boulders from predominantly shallow cavernous reefs have been extracted from Danish waters. Resent restoration efforts have shown that the loss of species diversity associated with boulder reef degradation may be reversed by restoring the boulder habitats. However, the debate about whether a “Single Large or Several Small” (SLOSS) will host the highest species richness and abundances in relation to restoration of boulder reefs has not been investigated. Here we show that construction of boulder reefs significantly increases species richness and abundances. Several small boulder reefs hosted a higher species richness than single large boulder reef, but there was no significant difference in abundances between single large and several small boulder reefs. Our results demonstrate that the SLOSS debate should be considered in future restoration as well in management plan for boulder reefs. Introduction One of the greatest challenges of the 21st century is the preservation of biodiversity by increasing the numbers of protected habitats. In Europe alone, less than 15% of the coastline areas are considered in a good environmental condition, leaving more than 85% of coastal areas degraded (Kristensen et al., 2017).

"5d34488fd9001d016b24698d_Vulnerability assessment of European fisheries to climate change (translated Analyse af Europas fiskeris sarbarhed over .pdf","Vulnerability assessment of European fisheries to climate change","Climate changes are happening and while many studies have looked into the possible biological, chemical and physical impacts thereof, it is more difficult to estimate the combined effects for fisheries. In recent last years, climate vulnerability analyse s (CVAs) of fisheries have been conducted in different parts of the wor ld, though in Europe the vulnerability of fisheries is still to be assessed. Europe consists of a combination of countries with large proportions of small -scale fisheries but little national economic dependence on fisheries and countries with large commercial fisheries, and where fisheries is of great national importance. In both cases sustaining fisheries is of high importan ce. A CVA can increase awareness and provide knowledge for policymakers to use in order to mitigate climate change. In this study, a vulnerability assessment of key European species to climate change using was performed using a methodology adapted from the IPCC fourth assessment report. The potential impacts of climate change were estimated as a combination of exposure and species s ensitivity based on current knowledge regime shifts resulting from climate change. Species are to dif ferent extent able to cope with climate change and thus adaptive capacity was also included in the CVA. The results showed tha t large commercial species fished by Northern and Western European countries were not highly vulnerable. Contrarily, Southern and Eastern European countries are hig hly dependent on species showing higher vul nerability such as European anchovy and sword fish. This work differs from other assessment in that i t uses an approach that is robust to knowledge poor situations. Europe is one of the most knowledge and data rich regions in the world , which makes it a good place for evaluating broad ba sed assessment methods. This is important, because many assessments are limited by a lack of data either on the effects of climate on fisheries, or national statistics (Allison et al., 2009) . Moreover, a further analysis of the vul nerability of European countries to clim ate change could be carried out based on the present assessment. In order to get a full overview of the vulnerability of European countries, a socio-economic aspect is necessary to include."
"68841cc293f4890102a19a57_Locally Consistent Parsing (translated Lokalt konstistent parsing).pdf","Locally Consistent Parsing","This thesis surveys different data structures, all using the concept oflocally consistent parsing. Locally consistent parsing is a way of process a string, S, of length n so that all identical substrings of a certain length, no matter their position in S, are treated the same way. Many problems related to string indexing can be solved within sublinear space using locally consistent data structures. We present several constructions of locally consistent partitionings. Two of these are based on prior work: the ( τ, δ)-partitioning set and the τ-synchronising set. Additionally, we introduce the (α, β, τ, ρ)-locally consistent set as a unifying framework to highlight the parallels and distinctions between the two existing partitionings. We demonstrate that given a τ-synchronising set, it is possible to construct a (τ, τ )-partitioning set in O   n τ  time. Furthermore, in the absence of periodic substrings, such a ( τ, τ )-partitioning set can be transformed into a (τ + 1)-synchronising set. This implies that one can use a deterministic O (n)-time construction of a τ-synchronising set, transform it into a ( τ, τ )-partitioning set in O   n τ  , and thereby obtain a faster construction than the previously suggested deterministic O (n log τ) approach. Continuing the literature survey of local consistency, we also cover the locally consistent grammar known as the signature grammar, a structure introduced in earlier literature. Using the main idea behind the signature grammars construction, we propose a new partitioning method called τ-local minimum set. Furthermore, two concepts of locality are introduced: index-based and block-based locality, and these are applied to the previously described partitionings. They are also used to clarify the difference between the problems which can be solved by the locally consistent partitionings with index-based locality properties and those solved by the signature grammar with block-based properties. Index- based locality ensures that when solving, for instance, problems similar to The Longest Common Extension Problem, it is possible to make very few look-ups in the original string and instead work on a much smaller string (of size n τ ) for most of the query. Block-based locality makes the original string superfluous and, in fact, works as a compression of the original string. It is possible to make string indexing queries on the compressed string. Finally, this thesis points to an inadequate part of the original correctness proof of the signature grammar’s string indexing query. We describe an example where the description in the paper would overlook an occurrence. We provide an updated query algorithm and prove that it works, while still preserving the runtime of the original algorithm. 2"

It plays a critical role in many modern sys- tems, especially in the field of databases, which need to handle and retrieve tons of information on a daily basis. The problem essentially deals with building efficient data structures for strings that would allow searching for online patterns. The ideal solution would show full efficiency by taking up both little space and building effort, while supporting fast operations. The current thesis proposes three new algorithms for the text indexing problem starting from the index structure of Ayad et al. [2], which uses anchors to come closer to the desired end goal. The first variant followed a naive strategy, the second used the benefits of akd-tree to improve the query times, and the last one adjusted the internal structure of the compact trie. The experimental evaluation indicates that searching times improve, but the space complexity remains more or less the same across the three algorithms. Most results of the thesis are similar to the ones of the index solution of Ayad et al. [2]. Specifically, the space of the data structure decreases as the number of anchors gets higher. The significance of these findings can be found in the benefits that anchors bring to the text indexing problem.

The live feed can as a vector for the pathogens . Takeover of o pportunistic pathogens can lead to severe yield and economical losses. Few preventive measures and treatments are commercially available for use in larviculture , such as antibiotics. The development and size of the larvae hinder the use of vaccines . The use of pro biotic Phaeobacter spp. is suggested as a solutio n, however little is known about how Phaeobacter spp. impact the natural bacterial community of the live feed. Thus the purpose of this study was to investigate how probiotic Phaeobacter piscinae S26, isolat ed from an aquaculture unit, influences a mock community of bacteria isolated from the microalgae Tetraselmis suecica. Sixteen bacterial isolates from T. suecica belonged to six genera; Algoriphagus, Mameliella, Marinobacter, Muricauda, Oceanicaulis and Roseovarius. An inhibition assay testing all strains and S26 towards each other showed that all, except those of Mameliella sp., were inhibited by the TDA production of S26. Furthermore, the Mameliella sp. two strains induced growth of the majority of the other strains. Five strains, belonging to the genera Algoriphagus, Muricauda, Mameliella, Oceanicaulis and Marinobacter , were selected to form a mock community based on the versatility of each strain. This community, both with and without probiotic P. pisci nae S26, had a significant influence on the growth of T. suecica , enhancing it immediately after addition, but causing no significant influence after eight days. Likewise, the presence of P. piscinae S26 in the bacterial community had a significant influe nce during the first two days, enhancing growth of Muricauda sp. and Oceanicaulis sp., while suppressing Algoriphagus sp., but with all five strains present after eight days no significant influence was observed. This indicates the formation of a stable co mmunity after establishment. Thus, this study concludes that implementation of P. piscinae as probiotic in T. suecica cultures is possible, without causing long lasting significant changes to the growth of the bacterial community or T. suecica. However, initial adaption of the community should be kept in mind in terms of how frequently the probiotic is added. The results of this study aim to contribute to the research and development on commercial use of Phaeobacter sp. as probiotics in aquaculture live feed, and thereby become a preventive measure towards vibiosis in marine larviculture."

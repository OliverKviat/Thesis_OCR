Traditionally, vibration responses in Frequency -Based Substructuring are measured using accelerometers. This study explores the feasibility of using a Scanning Laser Doppler Vibrometer as a non -contact alternative. The instrument offers distinct advantages, such as the ability to capture vibration responses across a predetermined grid of points without physically contacting the structure. The thesis includes both a numerical simulation and a physical experiment, comparing the coupled frequency response functions of a benchmark structure (obtained via Frequency-Based Substructuring) to the reference. Results from the simulation demonstrate strong agreement between the coupled system and the reference. The physical experiment also shows good agreement, even though it is slightly lower . This discrepancy is primarily attributed to the excitation method (a piezoelectric actuator ), which is just as critical as the measurement technique for obtaining accurate vibration data.","Data/RAW_test/68856e3fa0dada0102354c58_Frequency-based Substructuring using Scanning Laser Doppler Vibrometry (translated Frekvens-baseret substrukturering ved.pdf"

First, we optimise the All Nearest Smaller Values algorithm from (Berkman et al., 1993), and then we design a variant of it that is suitable for running on a GPU while performingO(n)work with O(log2(n))span on n lg(n) threads on a CREW PRAM. When implemented, our GPU version achieves a 4-5 times speed-up over our CPU version. We then design a GPU version of the precomputation of Lowest Common Ancestor queries described in (Schieber & Vishkin,1988) in order to answer Range Minimum Query queries in constant time. It performsO(n)work and has O( p nlog(n) )span on q n lg(n) − 1threads on a CREW PRAM.

The problem was first presented in [1] and combines routing and schedul- ing, two already hard classes of problems. It models a network of clients who each store a commodity. The amount each client has stored depletes over time. A client should never run out of this commodity, so we must ensure that we visit each client and refill their stock often enough. How quickly stock depletes varies from client to client, and it is allowed to visit and refill a client way before the clients stocks runs out. In this thesis we, like in [1], study both the Min-A vg and Min-Max versions of the problem, where the objectives are to minimize average cost of a route and minimize the cost of the longest route respec- tively. We cover the approximation algorithms on trees for both metrics given by [1] and we improve the complexity of their pseudo-polynomial algorithm for Min-A vg on a path. We then give a polynomial time algorithm for Min-Max on cycles, a 4-approximation for Min-A vg on cycles and insight into how a pseudo-polynomial algorithm for Min-A vg on cycles might be achieved. Finally we combine the ideas from the tree algorithms and cycle algorithms to give approximation algorithms for graphs, where all cycles are disjoint. On these graphs we give an algorithm for finding optimal routes, a 6 + NC-approximation for Min-Max, where NC is the number of cycles in a graph, and a 4-approximation for Min-A vg.

This thesis assess the potential of three remediation strategies: Biogeochemi- cal Reductive Dechlorination (BiRD), Enhanced Reductive Dechlorination (ERD), and their combined application to treat a cDCE-dominated contaminant plume at the Naverland site in Denmark. Laboratory-scale batch experiments were conducted using bioactive ground- water and limestone to simulate site-specific conditions. Four scenarios were tested: natural attenuation, GeoForm® Soluble (a ferrous sulfate-based amendment), KB-1® (a containing microbial consortium Dehalococcoides ), and a combination of GeoForm® and KB-1®. The results demonstrated that ERD using KB-1® was the most effective approach, achiev- ing complete dechlorination of cDCE to ethene with high degradation rates. Despite its the- oretical potential, BiRD produced no observable degradation of target compounds within the study’s duration due to delayed formation of reactive iron sulphide (FeS) and insuf- ficient reductive conditions. The combined treatment accelerated FeS formation through sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) in KB-1®. The high iron and sulphide concentrations from GeoForm® inhibited Dehalococcoides activity , significantly reducing degradation eﬀiciency. Despite this inhibition, the detection of vinyl chloride and ethene at low levels confirmed persistent biotic degradation.” These findings highlight the importance of redox control, amendment compatibility , and microbial resilience in remediation design. Given the site’s hydrogeology and buffering capacity , ERD using KB-1® is recommended for field-scale implementation.

In particular, it demonstrates the advantages of using the Stable Spline (SS) kernel for system identification. In addition to this hyperparameter selection is performed by optimizing cost­functions corresponding to the Profile Marginal­ ized Likelihood (PML) and Generalized Cross­Validation (GCV) criteria, where Bayesian optimization is utilized to efficiently locate their optimum point. Furthermore, an analyt­ ical approach based on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is introduced to reduce a variable from the cost­functions, significantly improving the computational efficiency of evaluating the cost­function and ultimately locating the optimum point. Additionally, the report explores how combining the PML and GCV criteria can lead to improved fit­scores. However, experimental results indicate no clear pattern for how the combination should be weighted.

"6882cb49016f110102ce9a4e_Algorithms for Text Indexing (translated Algoritmer for tekstindeksering).pdf","Algorithms for Text Indexing","Exploring Anchored Text Indexing","No","Philip Bille","The text indexing problem [1, 18] is a central topic in computer science, highly addressed by many scientists and professionals throughout time. It plays a critical role in many modern sys- tems, especially in the field of databases, which need to handle and retrieve tons of information on a daily basis. The problem essentially deals with building efficient data structures for strings that would allow searching for online patterns. The ideal solution would show full efficiency by taking up both little space and building effort, while supporting fast operations. The current thesis proposes three new algorithms for the text indexing problem starting from the index structure of Ayad et al. [2], which uses anchors to come closer to the desired end goal. The first variant followed a naive strategy, the second used the benefits of akd-tree to improve the query times, and the last one adjusted the internal structure of the compact trie. The experimental evaluation indicates that searching times improve, but the space complexity remains more or less the same across the three algorithms. Most results of the thesis are similar to the ones of the index solution of Ayad et al. [2]. Specifically, the space of the data structure decreases as the number of anchors gets higher. The significance of these findings can be found in the benefits that anchors bring to the text indexing problem.
